# Hacad Devlog – Real Estate Data Exploration

This repo contains data wrangling and exploratory analysis on Brazilian real estate datasets.

## Contents
- **data/** – raw and cleaned datasets
- **notebooks/** – analysis and wrangling steps (`data-wrangling-and-exploration.md`)
- **figures/** – generated plots for visualization

## Key Findings
- 🏠 Santa Catarina, Rio de Janeiro, and Pernambuco have the highest mean house prices.
- 📏 Area doesn’t strongly predict price on its own, though larger houses can reach much higher values.
- 🌍 Data covers multiple Brazilian states with property type, coordinates, and prices.

## Visualizations
- ![Mean House Price by State](figures/mean_house_price_by_state.png)
- ![Price vs. Area](figures/price_vs_area.png)

This project is part of my personal devlog experiments in data wrangling and visualization.
